- **Why**: Fast, lightweight NoSQL database
- **Usage**: Favorites, search history, offline data

### HTTP Client (Dio)
- **Why**: Powerful HTTP client with interceptors
- **Usage**: All API communications with error handling

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Custom Fonts**: Montserrat and Georgia for better readability
- **Smooth Animations**: Page transitions and loading states
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Bottom navigation with clear hierarchy
